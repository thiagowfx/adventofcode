Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of
magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack
is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves
have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of
fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has
plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in
case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the
first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
